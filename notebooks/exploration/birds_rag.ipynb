      "is followed by a detailed description of each main type  \n",
      "of habitat, from polar regions to deserts and urban \n",

      "THE POWER OF FLIGHT GIVES ANIMALS huge advantages, particularly in the search \n",
      "for food. Over millions of years, it has evolved independently in several different \n",
      "groups of animals, including ﬂying reptiles called pterosaurs, whose leathery wings \n",
      "were up to 12m (40ft) across. Today, the animal kingdom includes many species that \n",
      "can glide, but only three kinds of animal – birds, bats, and insects – can stay airborne \n",
      "by ﬂapping their wings. Of these, insects are by far the most numerous, but birds lead \n",
      "the ﬁeld in speed, endurance, load-carrying capacity, and total distance ﬂown.\n",
      "FLIGHT FORCES\n",
      "Flapping ﬂight is a highly complex form of \n",
      "movement, which is still not fully understood. \n",
      "However, the basic principles behind bird ﬂight are \n",
      "well known. Like aircraft, birds have to generate two \n",
      "forces to ﬂy. The ﬁrst, known as lift, counteracts the \n",
      "downward pull of Earth’s gravity. The second force, \n",
      "called thrust, counteracts air resistance or drag, and \n",
      "pushes the bird forwards. In both birds and aircraft, \n",
      "lift is produced by the stream of air moving over the \n",
      "curved surfaces of the wings, while in most birds \n",
      "thrust is produced by ﬂapping. However, bird wings \n",
      "are highly ﬂexible, and so ﬂapping ﬂight can involve \n",
      "many other factors as well. For example, pigeons \n",
      "generate extra lift by bringing their wings together \n",
      "on the upstroke, while hummingbirds can generate\n",
      "a constant downdraught by making each wing trace \n",
      "a path like a ﬁgure 8. Gliding birds (see p.34) are quite \n",
      "different: they exploit the air currents around them, \n",
      "saving much of the energy required in ﬂapping ﬂight.\n",
      "TAKEOFF AND LANDING\n",
      "Body weight has a far-reaching effect on the way birds take off \n",
      "and land. Small songbirds can take off in a split-second with just \n",
      "a kick of their legs, but heavily built birds take much longer to \n",
      "get into the air. Pheasants and other gamebirds are a notable \n",
      "exception to this rule: powerful ﬂight muscles give them an \n",
      "explosive take-off to escape from danger. Taking off can be\n",
      "hard work, and in heavy birds, the wing’s geometry changes\n",
      "to maximize lift and minimize energy-wasting turbulence.\n",
      "These changes are reversed once the bird is in the air.\n",
      "Landing requires careful coordination, and also plenty \n",
      "of space in the case of heavy birds such as bustards and \n",
      "swans. When birds land, they increase the angle of \n",
      "their wings, like an aeroplane lowering its ﬂaps. \n",
      "The bird then swings its legs forwards, and if all \n",
      "goes to plan, it lands on them without toppling \n",
      "over. But for a heavy bird, such as a swan,\n",
      "it is very difﬁcult to lose so much \n",
      "momentum in a short time. Instead, \n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "LANDING\n",
      "To land, a songbird drops its airspeed \n",

      "FLIGHT SPEEDS\n",
      "The speed of a ﬂying bird is difﬁcult to measure, so many records from \n",
      "the early years of ornithology are now thought to be unreliable. Birds are \n",
      "also experts at taking advantage of prevailing winds, and wind-assisted \n",
      "ﬂight can make some long-distance speed records misleading. However, \n",
      "there is little doubt that the Peregrine Falcon holds the absolute record \n",
      "for speed in the air. When it is diving, it probably exceeds 200kph\n",
      "(124mph). The fastest birds in level ﬂight are ducks, geese, and swifts. \n",
      "Some of these can reach an airspeed of nearly 80kph (50mph). In general, \n",
      "birds rarely ﬂy faster than 30kph (18mph). The slowest birds of \n",
      "all – woodcocks – can ﬂy at a leisurely 8kph (5mph) without \n",
      "stalling, which is not much faster than a brisk walk.\n",
      "FLIGHT PATTERNS\n",
      "Birds often have characteristic ﬂight patterns, \n",
      "which can help to identify them when they are \n",
      "on the wing. Some follow a level ﬂight path, ﬂapping their \n",
      "wings at a steady rate, varying from about 200 beats a minute \n",
      "for pigeons, to a much more leisurely 25 beats a minute for \n",
      "large birds such as herons. Many other birds intersperse ﬂapping \n",
      "with short bursts of gliding, but some species dip up and down, \n",
      "ﬂapping their wings in short bursts, and then holding them \n",
      "against their sides. This is common in ﬁnches, which have \n",

      "Songbirds are usually blind and featherless when they \n",

      "The majority of species nest off the ground, chieﬂy \n",
      "in trees and bushes, but songbirds also nest on rocks, \n",
      "in caves, and even behind waterfalls. Their nests are \n",
      "typically cup-shaped, but evolution has produced all \n",
      "kinds of reﬁnements to this basic design. One of the \n",

      "SOME GROUPS OF ANIMALS are easily confused, but there are no such \n",
      "problems with birds. They are the only animals that have feathers, and \n",
      "the only living vertebrates – apart from bats – that have evolved wings \n",
      "and powered ﬂight. Internally, they have a range of special features, \n",
      "including hollow bones, powerful ﬂight muscles, and a breathing \n",
      "system that extracts the maximum amount of oxygen from air. Thanks \n",
      "to these adaptations, some birds soar as high as passenger planes, while \n",
      "others spend years on the wing before ﬁnally landing to breed.  \n",
      "BIRD ANATOMY\n",
      "SKELETON AND MUSCLES\n",
      "All birds have evolved from the same distant ancestors \n",
      "and, as a result, they share the same underlying \n",
      "body plan. Their skeletons contain fewer bones \n",
      "than a mammal’s, and they have bills \n",
      "rather than teeth and jaws. Their wing \n",
      "bones are light and hollow, and end in  \n",
      "a three-ﬁngered “hand”, while their legs \n",
      "have a Z-like shape, with a raised ankle \n",
      "joint that looks like a backward-pointing \n",
      "knee. In most birds, the ribcage is compact, but the breastbone has  \n",
      "a large vertical ﬂap, called a keel, which acts as an anchor point for the \n",
      "muscles that power the wings. In fast or powerful ﬂiers, such as pigeons \n",
      "and doves, ﬂight muscles can make up 40 per cent of the body’s total \n",
      "weight. These muscles generate a large amount of heat, helping birds  \n",
      "to maintain their high body \n",
      "temperature, which averages  \n",
      "40–42ºC (104–107ºF).\n",
      "NERVOUS SYSTEM\n",
      "To ﬂy, birds need fast reactions, and an ability \n",
      "to process rapidly changing information, \n",
      "particularly from their eyes. Their brains are \n",
      "well developed and, in small birds, they can \n",
      "be twice as big as in mammals of a similar size. \n",
      "As well as ﬂying, birds carry out many kinds of \n",

      "and blood to move in opposite directions, known as countercurrent. As \n",
      "a result, bird lungs are more efﬁcient at transferring oxygen and carbon \n",
      "dioxide than those of mammals, so that some birds can ﬂy at over \n",
      "10,000m (33,000ft) – an altitude where a mammal would lose \n",
      "consciousness. Most ﬂying birds have nine air sacs, which connect with \n",

      "INHALATION 1\n",
